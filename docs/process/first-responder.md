# First Responder Rotation

We have a first responder rotation. Each rotation is a week long. While first responder your duties are:

1. Triage issues.
1. Review community pull requests.
1. Address technical debt, pet bugs, etc.

The goals of the rotation are to:

1. Ensure community issues and PRs are answered in a timely manner.
1. Ensure support load is shared across the whole team.
1. Allocate time to less prioritized work.

It's kind of a [big block of cheese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm9HZq53rqU) situation.
