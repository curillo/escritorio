# First Responder Rotation

We have a first responder rotation. The goals of the rotation are:

1. Ensure community issues and PRs are answered in a timely manner.
1. Ensure support load is shared across the whole team.
1. Free up the rest of the team to focus on milestone work.
1. Allocate time to less prioritized work.

Each rotation is a week long. While first responder your duties are:

1. Triage issues.
  * Troubleshoot or follow up on troubleshooting started by the previous first responder.
  * Review the [more-information-needed](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Amore-information-needed) and [needs-reproduction](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aneeds-reproduction) issues and close any that have gone 2 weeks with no new activity.
  * See https://github.com/desktop/issue-triage/blob/master/issue-triage.md for more information on our issue triage process.
1. Review community pull requests.
1. Address technical debt, pet bugs, etc.
1. Anything that supports the goals outlined above.

It's kind of a [big block of cheese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm9HZq53rqU) situation.
