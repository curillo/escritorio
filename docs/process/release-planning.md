# Release Planning

We plan work at two levels of granularity: first at the marketing release level (1.1, 1.2, etc.) and then at the milestone level. Marketing releases are made up of multiple milestones. Milestones should contain roughly a monthâ€™s worth of work.

Weâ€™ll release updates as needed or when a milestone is completed.

Large features and user-visible changes are feature-flagged, to be unflagged in the next marketing release. Beta and dev builds will have all feature flags enabled.

Below is the prototype release planner:
