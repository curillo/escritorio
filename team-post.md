# GitHub Desktop Internal Alpha

If you're feeling bold and courageous you can now try the rewritten Desktop app. Read on for instructions.

@pmn [gave an overview](https://team.githubapp.com/posts/28828) about a month ago of what's up with Desktop. The tl;dr is that we're rebooting it on Electron. We've been working on it for a few months. It's far from complete, it's rough around the edges, but if you're feeling bold and courageous you can try it out now.

1. [Add yourself to the desktop org](http://central.github.com/invite_to_desktop_org).
2. [Download the latest release](https://central.github.com/deployments).
3. [File issues](http://github.com/desktop/desktop/issues/new).

The UI is still being designed, so if you're looking for some functionality but can't find a button for it, check the menu. Some notable examples:

1. Create branch.
2. Checkout branch.
3. Push.
4. Pull.

There's still a lot of work to be done but it _should_ be usable for day to day committing, pushing, and pulling.
