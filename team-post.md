# GitHub Desktop TNG Beta

GitHub Desktop TNG will be launching the week before Satellite on May 16th.

### Public Beta

We're calling the initial release a beta. This is for a few reasons:

1. It's gonna be buggy. @tierninho has been doing a great job doing QA for us, but this is a brand new application. There will be bugs.
1. It's incomplete. We've opted to get this into the hands of users sooner than later, and in order to do that we've [punted on some issues](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/milestone/7).
1. We're open to feedback. What do users miss from the Desktop Classic apps? What features were unnecessary?

### Open Source

Desktop will be open source from day one. We have no idea how involved the community will be but we're excited to find out :smile:
