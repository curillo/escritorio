# GitHub Desktop Internal Alpha

If you're feeling bold and courageous you can now try the rewritten, Electron-based Desktop app.

@pmn [gave an overview](https://team.githubapp.com/posts/28828) about a month ago of what's up with Desktop. The tl;dr is that we're rebooting it on Electron. We've been working on it for a few months. It's far from complete, it's rough around the edges, and we'd love if you'd try it out. We're hoping that by getting GitHubbers using it early in the process we can uncover any bugs in our foundation.

1. [Add yourself to the desktop org](http://central.github.com/invite_to_desktop_org).
2. Download the latest release ([macOS](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/darwin), [Windows](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/win32)).
3. [File issues for any bugs you find](http://github.com/desktop/desktop/issues/new) or hop in #desktop and tell us.

The UI is still being designed, so if you're looking for some functionality but can't find a button for it, check the menu. Some notable examples:

1. Create branch.
2. Checkout branch.
3. Push.
4. Pull.

There's still a lot of work to be done but it _should_ be usable for day to day committing, pushing, and pulling. Please file issues for any bugs you come across. Auto-updates _should_ be working (see above about the bleeding edge) so once you download and install the app, you should be good to go.
