# GitHub Desktop Internal Alpha

If you're feeling bold and courageous you can now try the rewritten Desktop app.

@pmn [gave an overview](https://team.githubapp.com/posts/28828) about a month ago of what's up with Desktop. The tl;dr is that we're rebooting it on Electron. We've been working on it for a few months. It's far from complete, it's rough around the edges, but if you don't mind living on the bleeding edge you can try it out now.

1. [Add yourself to the desktop org](http://central.github.com/invite_to_desktop_org).
3. [File issues for any bugs you find](http://github.com/desktop/desktop/issues/new).
2. Download the latest release ([macOS](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/darwin), [Windows](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/win32)).

The UI is still being designed, so if you're looking for some functionality but can't find a button for it, check the menu. Some notable examples:

1. Create branch.
2. Checkout branch.
3. Push.
4. Pull.

There's still a lot of work to be done but it _should_ be usable for day to day committing, pushing, and pulling. Please file issues for any bugs you come across. Auto-updates _should_ be working (see above about the bleeding edge) so once you download and install the app, you should be good to go.
