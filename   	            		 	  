In recent years, wireless mesh networks (WMN) have become more popular than ever. Many
technologies, like IEEE 802.11s, IEEE 802.15 (multi-hop mode), IEEE 802.16 (mesh mode) and
wireless sensor network, etc., are of this kind. A multi-hop WMN can not only extend coverage
but also save both cabling cost and human resource. WMN is essentially robust in fault tolerance.
Even if some of the mesh nodes are incapable, there exist many other alternative nodes to help
relay. It is demanding a full mesh to have the best fault tolerance. However, this condensed mesh
nodes deployment may cause significant packet collisions. Gupta [4] found that given n identical
nodes, each node is within each other‚Äô communication range and is in the same collision domain.

networks between given source destination pairs using a simple interference model. Kumar [9]
considered the same problem for various interference models. However, they both do not take
channel allocation into account as they consider a single-channel network. Mesh routers with
multiple-radios can transmit and receive simultaneously or can transmit on multiple channels
simultaneously seems to be a feasible solution. Gupta [4] pointed out that one of the major
problems facing wireless networks is the capacity reduction due to interference among multiple
simultaneous transmissions. Alicherry [1] believed that the interference cannot be completely
eliminated due to the limited number of channels available and suggested that careful channel
assignment must be done to mitigate the effects of interference. Kyasanur [10] proposed
algorithms for channel assignment and routing in multi-channel multiple Network Interface Card
(NIC) MANETs. Subramanian [18] assigned channels to communication links to minimize the
overall interference in a multiradio wireless mesh network. Tang [19] used topology control and
QoS routing in multi-channel wireless mesh networks to deal with interference problem. Jain [7]
used conflict graph to model wireless interference and detected the group of links that might
have significant interference. Jain further proved that the problem of finding optimal throughput
is NP-hard. Padhye [13] and Reis [16] proposed to use measurement-based techniques to derive
conflict graphs. Ramachandran [14] proposed a purely measurement-based approach for channel
assignment to radios. Moaveninejad [12] extended the results from [3] and proposed algorithms
for constructing a network topology in wireless ad hoc networks such that the maximum (or
average) link (or node) interference of the topology is either minimized or approximately
minimized. Hsiao [5] identified the links intersection problem of nodes using directional
antennas in a wireless network. Hsiao showed that if a line intersection occurs and the four ends
(nodes) of the two intersected lines are communicating at the same time then all the four nodes
will interfere with each other. Burkhart [3] showed that low degree of nodes does not guarantee
low interference in a wireless network. Since the transmission range of a node is determined by
the longest path, one node with low degree may have large transmission range. Once it transmits
data, it may interfere the transmissions of the others. Some proposals originated in computational
geometry, such as the Delaunay Triangulation [6], the minimum spanning tree [15] and the
Gabriel Graph [17]. Hu [6] applied Delaunay Triangulation (DT) algorithm to solve network
problem. Delaunay Triangulation algorithm is able to maximize all the angles in a geometric
graph and thus shorten the lengths of links. Delaunay Triangulation algorithm is able to reduce
the total length of links while keep the same total degrees of nodes. Mapping to the network
problem, reducing lengths of links implies reducing transmission ranges among nodes. This may
help to mitigate the interference problem. Figure 1(a) shows an original network topology
modeled by a graph. Figure 1(b) is the triangulated network topology applying Delaunay
Triangulation algorithm. It shows that many links in Figure 1(b) are shorter than those in Figure
1(a). Meguerdichian [11] applied Voronoi diagram and Delaunay Triangulation algorithm to
wireless sensor networks to optimize sensors deployment.

In this paper, we extend links intersection problem of directional antennas to that of omnidirectional antennas, and focus on enhancing network performance by minimizing the
interference among nodes. We convert network problem into geometry problem by defining line
intersection in a graph to reflect radio interference problem. We then use plan sweep algorithm to
find if there exists any intersection lines. We further employ Voronoi diagram algorithm and
Delaunay Triangulation algorithm to reconstruct the graph in order to minimize the interference
among nodes. Finally, we use standard deviation to prune off those longer links (higher
interference links) to have a further enhancement of network performance. The paper
organization is as follows. Section 2 is the framework of the proposed solution. Section 3 shows
the simulations and results using NS2 (Network Simulator 2). Section 4 offers brief concluding
remarks.
2. FRAMEWORK
The operation flow of the proposed interference reduction framework is as follows (Figure 2). In
the beginning, nodes deployment and positioning is used to deploy mesh nodes in a target area.
Positioning can be done by either of GPS, AOA (Angle of Arrival), TDOA (Time Difference of
Arrival) or RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator), etc. Locations broadcast is used to
broadcast nodes coordinates to their neighbors. Hence, each node will be able to know the
coordinates of those nodes within its transmission range. Network problems are converted to
geometry problems and then these problems are solved by geometric algorithms. Those
algorithms used by the framework are plane sweep algorithm, Voronoi diagram algorithm and
Delaunay Triangulation algorithm. Plan sweep algorithm is used to check line intersections.
Voronoi diagram algorithm is used to search neighboring nodes. Delaunay Triangulation
algorithm is used to reduce the lengths of links among nodes (or to reduce the interference
among nodes). Finally, we use standard deviation to prune off those longer links (or higher
interference links) to have a further enhancement of network performance. Transmission power
of sensors will thus be adjusted according to the results of these geometric algorithms. This
completes an iteration of interference reduction process. Since the topology is apt to changed,
nodes insertion and deletion is required to keep the topology up to date.

2.1 Line Intersection Problem
Line intersection in geometry can be mapped to the interference problem in a real network when
two intersected pairs of communication nodes are transmitting data at the same time. If the
communication between one of these two pairs can be redirected to the other nodes, it is possible
not only to avoid collisions but also reduce both the transmission radii of communication nodes
and the number of interfered nodes. Therefore, it is possible to largely reduce communication
interference by removing some intersected lines in graph. Figure 3 shows that there are nodes A,
B, C and D in a WMN and each node is equipped with an omni-directional antenna. We assume
that node A is communicating with node B and node C is communicating with node D at the
same time. Without loss of generality, segment AB may be longer than or equal to segment CD.
In the first case, the transmission range of node A will cover node D and C, in the second case,
node A, B, C or D are able to cover each other. In either case, interference can be reduced by
removing one of these two intersected segments. Figure 4(a) shows that if any node of a fully
mesh WMN wants to send messages to another node then all the other nodes must stay in
listening mode. This may significantly reduce system throughput. If Figure 4(a) is transformed
into Figure 4(b) by removing intersected lines then nodes F and B are able to send messages to
node E and C, respectively, at the same time.

Figure 6. Data structure of an event queue.
Plane sweep algorithm is used to check line intersections in a geometric graph. Plane sweep
algorithm is realized as follows. All the lines are numbered in advance. Scan all the lines in the
graph from top to bottom (Figure 5). Once there is an endpoint of a line found, say an ‚Äúevent
point‚Äù, we add this point to an ‚Äúevent queue‚Äù, a balanced binary tree (Figure 6). The event queue
is used to maintain the event points of line intersection check. An event point won't be removed
from an event queue until the line of that event point passes line scan. Plane sweep algorithm has
time complexity, O((n+I) log n), where n is the number of event points and I is the number of
intersection points. As a comparison, the time complexity of that of using brute force algorithm
is O(n
2
) instead.
2.3 Voronoi Diagram Algorithm
In a Voronoi diagram, it holds the property that the nearest site of any point x in a sub-area V(Pi)
must be Pi(site). Voronoi diagram algorithm is used here to find the dividing lines and adjacent
nodes. The time complexity of Voronoi diagram is O(n log n), where n is the number of nodes.
The definition of Voronoi diagram is as follows. Let P = {P1, P2,
...,Pn}, n2, where P is a set of
nodes in an area, and P1, P2,
..., Pn are sites. Let V(P)={V(P1),V(P2),......,V(Pn)}, where
V(Pi)={x:Pi-xPj-x, ji}. V(P) is called a Voronoi diagram.

2.4 Delaunay Triangulation Algorithm
Delaunay Triangulation algorithm is used to reduce the lengths of links among nodes. This
algorithm will be applied to our problem in two cases. First is in the case of original topology
transformation. Second is in the case of topology reconstruction after nodes addition and
deletion. Delaunay Triangulation algorithm uses Legal Triangulation [2] algorithm to optimize
polygons. Figure 8 shows two cases of triangulated polygons. If the sum of angles Œ± 2
and Œ± 6
is
greater than that of Œ±1'and Œ± 6'then edge PiPj
is said to be an ‚Äúillegal edge‚Äù and the flipped edge
PlPk
is said to be a ‚Äúlegal edge‚Äù. Legal Triangulation algorithm flips an ‚Äúillegal edge‚Äù into a
‚Äúlegal edge‚Äù. The time complexity of Delaunay Triangulation diagram is O(n log n), where n is
the number of nodes.
Figure 8. Example of Delaunay Triangulation.
As nodes deployed in different locations, each node may either have ‚Äúdirect interference‚Äù,
‚Äúindirect interference‚Äù, or ‚Äúno interference‚Äù on other nodes. Direct interference means that once
a node wants to transmit data, all those nodes within its transmission range should stay in
listening mode to avoid collision. Indirect interference means that once a node wants to transmit
data to its neighboring nodes, those nodes which would like to communicate with these
neighboring nodes must stay in listening mode. No interference means that once a node wants to
transmit data, there is no worry about collision to those neighboring nodes. Given a full mesh
network of six nodes in Figure 9, three possible triangulated graphs by Delaunay Triangulation
algorithm are shown in Figure 10. Comparing Table 1 with Tables 2 to 4, we find the variations
of interference effects on neighboring nodes given distinct network topologies. Triangulated
graphs can really mitigate the interference problem to a certain degree.

2.5 Path Modification
To keep the property of connectivity, path modification should be based on clustering. A group
of close related nodes are grouped into one cluster. There exists at least one path between two
clusters. In a geometric graph, the degree of a node equals to the number of paths (links). The
longest path of a node is thought to be the transmission range. Figure 11 shows that path AB is
the longest link for both node A and node B. Hence, the transmission range of node A and node
B is the length of AB. When node A or node B starts to transmit data, all the other nodes should
stay in listening mode since they all are within the transmission range of radius AB. To reduce
such interference, we apply standard deviation to prune off those relatively longer links.
Figure 11. Path AB is the longest link of both node A and node B.
In deciding which links to remove, we classify the standard deviation ranges at both endpoints of
a link into four levels as shown in Table 5. We also associate probability with each level of
range. We set Level 0 and Level 3 have the highest and the least probabilities of occurrences,
respectively. Since both endpoints of one link may not fall on the same level, the priority of link
pruning depends on the joint level of standard deviation ranges at both endpoints. The priority is
set according to Table 6. In addition, if two links have the same link pruning priority, the link
covers more nodes will be removed first. For example, if a node is of degree 9 and each of its
links has different lengths and different number of covered nodes as shown in Table 7. The
priorities of links to be removed are numbered as follows: 2, 4, 8, 5, 7, 6, 3, 9, 1.

2.6 Nodes Insertion and Deletion
(a) (b)
Figure 12. Examples of node insertion.
As a node is to be inserted into a network, it has to broadcast its own coordinates to neighboring
nodes. The system is then triggered to execute plane sweep algorithm to re-sweep and execute
Delaunay Triangulation algorithm to reconstruct network topology. The time complexity of node
insertion is O(n log n). Figure 12 shows two examples of node insertion. Figure 12(a) is the case
when the new node Pr falls in the area of a triangle, and Figure 12(b) is the case when Pr
lies on
the border of two triangles. Figure 13 shows the topology reconstruction after node insertion.
Once a node fails or moves out, it triggers node deletion and then topology reconstruction. Node
deletion is triggered once the neighboring nodes of a certain node do not receive periodic
location update from that node afte
