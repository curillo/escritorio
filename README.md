# [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)

[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is an open source [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)-based
GitHub app. It is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and
uses [React](https://reactjs.org/).

## Where can I get it?

Download the official installer for your operating system:

 - [macOS](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/darwin)
 - [macOS (Apple Silicon)](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/darwin-arm64)
 - [Windows](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/win32)
 - [Windows machine-wide install](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/win32?format=msi)

You can install this alongside your existing GitHub Desktop for Mac or GitHub
Desktop for Windows application.

Linux is not officially supported; however, you can find installers created for Linux from a fork of GitHub Desktop in the [Community Releases](https://github.com/desktop/desktop#community-releases) section.

**NOTE**: There is no current migration path to import your existing
repositories into the new application - you can drag-and-drop your repositories
from disk onto the application to get started.

## I have a problem with GitHub Desktop

Note: The [GitHub Desktop Code of Conduct](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/blob/development/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) applies in all interactions relating to the GitHub Desktop project.

First, please search the [open issues](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/issues?q=is%3Aopen)
and [closed issues](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/issues?q=is%3Aclosed)
to see if your issue hasn't already been reported (it may also be fixed).

There is also a list of [known issues](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/blob/development/docs/known-issues.md)
that are being tracked against Desktop, and some of these issues have workarounds.

If you can't find an issue that matches what you're seeing, open a [new issue](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/issues/new/choose),
choose the right template and provide us with enough information to investigate
further.

## The issue I reported isn't fixed yet. What can I do?

If nobody has responded to your issue in a few days, you're welcome to respond to it with a friendly ping in the issue. Please do not respond more than a second time if nobody has responded. The GitHub Desktop maintainers are constrained in time and resources, and diagnosing individual configurations can be difficult and time consuming. While we'll try to at least get you pointed in the right direction, we can't guarantee we'll be able to dig too deeply into any one person's issue.

## How can I contribute to GitHub Desktop?

The [CONTRIBUTING.md](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) document will help you get setup and
familiar with the source. The [documentation](docs/) folder also contains more
resources relevant to the project.
